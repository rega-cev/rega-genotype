now:
* fix upload button
* allow to delete job results
* job overview:
	* format summary and overview table
	* remove the annotations from the genome images
	* Excell -> Excel
	* XML export -> has description field with blabla
* treepuzzle problem with 1 of the example seqs (is this MacOS specific?)
* add cancel analysis option
* test back button in the app
* is there still a problem with "Retrieve results" button?
* citations -> pubmed liks
* example sequence in the input field
	-> remove, maybe add extra button "Try examples"
	-> if we do not remove it, should disappear when the text field is clicked?
* restyle + fix upload button

HIV doc:
* submitting a sequence, revisiting a job 
	-> documentation
* A basic phylogenetics explanation or at least a link to a nice explanation is needed for those who are unfamiliar and want to know more
** Examples questions:
*** What is the meaning of like?
*** What is the meaning of the brackets, specially for G (14_BG), A (01_AE)? Even though they are in the decision trees., they do not understand the meaning.
* remove readseq from the doc
* fix the naming of the example seqs (use the genbdank id)
* update the typing rules in the tutorial
* include recombinant in the examples

later:
* links to CSV, XLS and XML file: should be accessible via URL (eg: /job/$jobid$/csv)
* exportable citations
