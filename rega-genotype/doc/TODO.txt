* details pics, generate them during analysis?
* ref seq name is too long
* report form: Indicate how long results are kept (configuration option).
* check the jobDir whether it exists, if not give an appropriate error message
* google find the subtypetool (meta content)
* HIV/HTLV report bootstrap is not showing

LATER

* no introduction-form exception
* is title-filtered field allways nececessary?
* doc rule css
* example seqs formatting
* upload file, # seqs in fasta > # allowed seqs -> no message, just nothing happens
