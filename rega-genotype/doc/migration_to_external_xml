Repositories:

We added a central repository that conatins all the published tools. 
Comunication to that repository is done from admin UI (http://localhost:8080/rega-genotype/admin/)
repoUrl =  http://typingtools.emweb.be/repository/repo-service

All the tools that existed before the migration are stored in a test repository.
repoUrl =  http://typingtools.emweb.be/repository-test/repo-service
The authers of this tools can connect to this repository (set repoUrl),
download there tools, connect to the "real repository" (set repoUrl) and publish the tool.

Developers can create local repository by setting 
Global settings filed repoUrl to http://localhost:8080/rega-genotype/admin/
